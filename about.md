Volunteers and Members
---------------

If you would like to volunteer, please fill out a [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScfNztaxF7_Ahza3_E-PorLcoEgU-4mCi82y1bi8JbrmyzvCw/viewform). (Kids, let your parents fill the form out) You can also become a member by talking to us at one of the meetings that you have volunteered to attend. Members are expected to attend at least 2 meetings a month. Members are also allowed to attend meetings where they are allowed to have an opinion in what we are deciding on. If you cannot make it to at least 2 meetings a month and this happens continuously, you no longer have the right of a member. Volunteers must fill out a form for every meeting they attend, members are allowed to come whenever they would like. 


More about HHOW
----------------

We are taking volunteers who are the age of 13 or under. One of our main ideas about our organization is that 'Kids Can Do Great Things Too' We are trying to get across a point that you don't have to be an adult to do something that makes a difference in the world. If you are filling out a volunteering form and are bringing multiple children, please fill out a seperate form for each child. 


Our Newsletter
--------------

Our new members for the week will be named in our weekly newsletter that will be on the front page of our website. The newsletter will include, New members for the week, this week's and upcoming weeks' meetings, and other important information for the week.
