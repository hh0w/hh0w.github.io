What is HHOW all about?
----------------------

What does HHOW stand for? Helping Hands of Winchester. What is our overall goal? We are trying to make winchester, and eventually Virginia, a better place. What sort of things do we do?  We clean up the community by picking up litter, making food bags for homeless people, food and money donations excepted, and giving clothes to the homeless, clothing donations also excepted, so if you have any clothes that you don't like or that don't fit anymore, send them our way and they will be greatly appreciated, please make sure that your clothes don't have holes, bugs, or any other issues. We will check them and see if we accept them or not. If you would like to donate to us or other organizations like us, please [click here](/donations). To learn more please go to our [informational page](/about) or contact us through our email or social media.
